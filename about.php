<h1>About</h1>
<div id="pagebody">

      <div id="bio">
        <p>Grace is a current undergraduate student at Cornell University in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' Class of 2020, majoring in Information Science, and minoring in Spanish and Business.
        <p>Before deciding to major in Information Science, Grace built a strong background in a variety of fields, including economics, romance studies, communication, mathematics, and more. Her experiences from prior coursework and interests continue to influence her well-roundedness of thought - a trait she aims to apply in her more technical studies and endeavors.
          As a Charleston, South Carolina native, Grace was drawn to Cornell because of the University's wide range of coursework options for its students, and as a student with such a variety of interests, the University surely continues to satisfy her never-ending desire to learn.
          Grace decided to fully pursue the Information Science major in the first semester of her sophomore year, and has been sure to include coursework pertaining to her other interests along with those for her major.
        <p>Prior to attending Cornell, Grace attended Academic Magnet High School, a nationally-ranked public magnet program in North Charleston, South Carolina. There, she flourished in the intellectually-stimulating environment provided by the entirely Honors and AP curriculum, varsity sports teams, and emphasis on academic research exposure.
          At AMHS, Grace was appointed Editor-In-Chief of the school yearbook in her junior year, and again in her senior year -- a first in the history of the school. In this position, Grace led a staff of about 20 of her peers through the entirety of the publication process, while taking particular interest in developing page layouts for the entirety of the books.
          <p>She pursued the more academic side of this design interest as her <a href="Thesis.pdf">senior thesis</a> - a requirement for graduation with honors at AMHS, wherein students choose a unique topic of interest on which to conduct a year-long academic research project, modelled after a master's-level thesis.
          Her thesis led her to investigating basic principles of design and how to apply them most effectively to appeal to adolescents through a print advertisement public service campaign aimed to increase adolescent awareness of the importance of driver and roadside safety.
          Grace decided on this subject for her thesis because of her desire to continue her initiative addressed in her Girl Scout Gold Award Project, for which she developed and carried-out a hands-on workshop for new teen drivers teaching them valuable and under-stressed knowledge of roadside safety and maintenance procedures, such as changing tires, checking oil, and performing jump-starts on a disabled vehicle.
        <p>Grace continued her undeniable knack for page design from her high school experiences in yearbook and design research as a Cornell student, where she was hired by the Cornellian Yearbook as Head Page Designer for the book's sesquicentennial volume.
          The honor Grace feels granted by this position and its importance in representing the history of Cornell is truly cherished, and she is working diligently and excitedly to uphold the standards of design and sentiment brought by the publication and the great university for which it is made.</p>
