# Grace Rieflin - Course Assignment: Personal Portfolio
*(completed Feb. 2018)*
## INFO 2300 - Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web - Project 1

For the first major project assignment for this course, students were asked to create multi-page websites with interactive features of their choice (such as forms). I chose to create a bare-bones personal professional portfolio site, highlighting some of my creative works.
